# running-config Parser

A parser for running-config files of Brocade switches (FGS, FCX, ICX).

It takes a configuration file generated by a command like 'show running-config' or 'copy running-config tftp', analyzes this file and returns the sections of interest in a dictionary format.

So far only the vlan settings section is being analyzed.
